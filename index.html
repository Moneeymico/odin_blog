       <h1> Day 1 of Learning HTML</h1>
       <!-- Strong Creates a bold style for HTML language -->
       <p>So today i am learning how to code in html which is super exciting! we are learning that 
       <strong>Strong</strong> creates <strong>Bold</strong> text. </p>
       <!-- Em is is HTML language for Italic it stands for emphasis -->
       <p>We have learnt that <em>em</em> creates <em>Italic</em> text</p>
       <!-- do NOT use B and I tags as it doesnt help with website accessibility -->
       <p>if i want Bold Italic i simply do Strong and EM tags between the words like this. <em><strong>HEY THERE</strong></em></p>
       <p> I am also learning how to do a list in this case ill start with a <strong><em>Unordered List</em></strong></p>
       <!-- UL stands for Unordered List -->
       <ul> 
            <li>Fredo Frogs</li>
            <li>Dunkaroos</li>
            <li>Fruit Rollups</li>
            <li>Poweraid</li>
       </ul>  
       <p>In this next example ill do a <strong><em> Ordered List</em></strong> top foods:</p>
       <!-- OL stands for Ordered List! -->
        <ol>    
            <li>Spaghetti Bologenese</li>
            <li>Pizza</li>
            <li>Ramen</li>
            <li>Sushi</li>
            <li>Juice</li> 
        </ol>
        <!-- a href is a reference point for the link and will go where ever you link it too!! not having the href will still allow it to be linkable but wont be blue. -->
        <p> We have also learnt now how to add <stong><em>Links</em></stong> to other websites for example:</p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>
        <p> The above link will load on the same page, there is also a way to link something and open it by defult on another tab</p>
        <!-- The noopener is a security protocal which allows us to visit another webpage without another page swooping in and creating chaos -->
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>
        <p> I have also learned how to create a <strong><em>About</em></strong> page </p>
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About Me</a>
        <!-- Next part will demo how to add images to a main page and also link to a new pages in the case About.html -->
        <p> Next we see how to add an <strong><em>image</em></strong> to the webiste </p>
        <img src="./images/Broly.jpeg" alt="Picture of Broly SSJ" height="500" width="500">
        <!-- we can also add an image to the about pages but pulling it from!  -->
         <p> So if we link back to the <a href="./pages/about.html">About Page</a> we should be able to see the same image on the next page.</p> 
         <p> attemping to create a git message using git commit</p>
