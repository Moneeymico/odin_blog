       <h1 class="h1"> Day 1 of Learning HTML</h1>
       <!-- Strong Creates a bold style for HTML language -->
       <p class="body-txt"> today i am learning how to code in html which is super exciting! we are learning that 
       <strong>Strong</strong> creates <strong>Bold</strong> text. </p>
       <!-- Em is is HTML language for Italic it stands for emphasis -->
       <p class="body-txt">We have learnt that <em>em</em> creates <em>Italic</em> text</p>
       <!-- do NOT use B and I tags as it doesnt help with website accessibility -->
       <p class="body-txt">if i want Bold Italic i simply do Strong and EM tags between the words like this. <em><strong>HEY THERE</strong></em></p>
       <p class="body-txt"> I am also learning how to do a list in this case ill start with a <strong><em>Unordered List</em></strong></p>
       <!-- UL stands for Unordered List -->
       <ul class="unordered-list-1">
            <li>Fredo Frogs</li>
            <li>Dunkaroos</li>
            <li>Fruit Rollups</li>
            <li>Poweraid</li>
       </ul>  
       <p class="body-txt">In this next example ill do a <strong><em> Ordered List</em></strong> top foods:</p>
       <!-- OL stands for Ordered List! -->
        <ol class="ordered-list-1">    
            <li>Spaghetti Bologenese</li>
            <li>Pizza</li>
            <li>Ramen</li>
            <li>Sushi</li>
            <li>Juice</li> 
        </ol>
        <!-- a href is a reference point for the link and will go where ever you link it too!! not having the href will still allow it to be linkable but wont be blue. -->
        <p class="body-txt"> We have also learnt now how to add <stong><em>Links</em></stong> to other websites for example:</p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"class="link-txt">About The Odin Project</a>
        <p class="body-txt"> The above link will load on the same page, there is also a way to link something and open it by defult on another tab</p>
        <!-- The noopener is a security protocal which allows us to visit another webpage without another page swooping in and creating chaos -->
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"class="link-txt">About The Odin Project</a>
        <p class="body-txt"> I have also learned how to create a <strong><em>About</em></strong> page </p>
        <a href="./pages/about.html"class="link-txt" >About Me</a>
        <!-- Next part will demo how to add images to a main page and also link to a new pages in the case About.html -->
        <p class="body-txt"> Next we see how to add an <strong><em>image</em></strong> to the webiste </p>
        <img src="./images/Broly.jpeg" alt="Picture of Broly SSJ" height="500" width="500">
        <!-- we can also add an image to the about pages but pulling it from!  -->
         <p class="body-txt"> So if we link back to the <a href="./pages/about.html">About Page</a> we should be able to see the same image on the next page.</p> 
         <p class="body-txt"> attemping to create a git message using git commit</p>
         <!-- CSS can be added 3 different ways to the HTML which will be shown. -->
          <p class="body-txt">CSS can be added 3 different ways the first way is an external CSS sheet saved as a different file with .css
          2nd way is by adding it internaly in between the header tags at the top of the page. 3rd way is not reccomended as you add it directly into the html body as you go. 
          Ill be adding CSS to this blog post as i go.</p>
          
          <!-- this way is inline and not reccomended  -->
          <div style="color: white; background-color: rgb(76, 0, 255); font-size: 24px;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center;">we can create a slight background and text change color in a specific area like this</div>
